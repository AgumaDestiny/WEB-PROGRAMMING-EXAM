GOOGLE DEVELOPERS STUDENT CLUB
WEB PROGRAMMING EXAMINATION
Google Developer Student Clubs (DSCs) are community groups for university and college students interested in learning about Google technologies and developer tools. These clubs are open to any student, regardless of their academic background or major.
DSCs are organized and supported by Google Developers, who provide resources and guidance to help students learn, grow, and build projects using Google's technologies. DSCs offer a variety of activities, including workshops, study jams, speaker sessions, hackathons, and hands-on projects.
The primary goal of DSCs is to help students become better developers by providing them with opportunities to learn from experienced developers, collaborate with other students, and build real-world projects using Google's technologies. Through these activities, students can gain valuable skills, build their portfolios, and prepare for careers in the tech industry.
DSCs are present in universities and colleges all around the world and are a great way for students to connect with like-minded individuals, learn new skills, and make an impact in their communities through technology.
Using the above context, imagine that you are the technology lead for the club chapter of Uganda Christian University. The core team has decided to create a simple Web Application called DSC_UCU_Community for the management of its members. The application should have features in the specification below.

FEATURES SPECIFICATIONS FOR DSC UCU COMMUNITY WE APPLICATION.
a) Collect Member Information: The application should collect basic information from the user, such as their name, email address, phone number, and any other relevant details that the club wants to gather.
b) Validate Information: Using regular expressions or any other method, the application should validate the information provided by the user to ensure that it is accurate and complete. For example, the application should verify that the user has provided a valid email address or phone number.
c) Store Information: The application should store the member's information in a database or other data storage system like local storage so that the club can access it later.
d) Display Confirmation: The application should display a confirmation message to the user after they have completed the registration process. This message should include a summary of the information that they have provided and any other relevant details about the club.
e) Authenticate Users: The application should allow users to authenticate themselves by logging in with their email and password or through a social media account. In the addition to this; when a user logs in, he/she should be presented with a simple welcome screen that contains a proper representation of his/her profile from the details they provided during registration.
f) Provide Access to Member-only Content: The application should be able to grant registered members access to any exclusive content, features, or benefits that the club provides.
g) Manage Membership: The application should be able to track and manage the membership of the club. For example, it should be able to show the number of registered members, and their status and allow for member updates, deletions, or other modifications.
h) Send Email Notifications: It should be able to send an email confirmation to the user after they have completed the registration process, and any other email notifications related to club activities or other updates.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
